Dynamic Quiz Generation:

Description:
A cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application developed using Next.js, aimed at streamlining quiz creation for educators. It utilizes the OpenAI API to automate the generation of unique and adaptive quiz questions based on selected difficulty levels. The application also employs a robust SQL database for user management, quiz content storage, and efficient grading processes for both teachers and students.

Xero-Degrees:

Description:
Employing the Apriori algorithm, I analyzed a vast dataset comprising 1 million rows, uncovering intricate associations among grocery items. This data-driven exploration facilitated the development of a dynamic Next.js web application. The application enables users to seamlessly add products to their virtual carts while receiving real-time recommendations based on the association rules derived from the analysis. By integrating these insights into the e-commerce experience, the project aimed to enhance user engagement and streamline the online shopping journey. Ultimately, the application's personalized recommendations hold the potential to boost sales and foster a more satisfying shopping experience for users.
